# Smallest-Difference-Two-Arrays

ALGO EXPERT MEDIUM

Write a function that takes in two non-empty arrays of integers, fins the pair of numbers(one from each array) whose absolute different is closest to<br> zero, and returns an array containing these two numbers, with the number from the first array in the first position.<br>
Note that the absolute difference of two integers is the distance between them on the real number line. <br>
For example, the absolute different of -5 and 5 is 10, and the absolute difference of -5 and -4 is 1.<br>
You can assume that there will only be one pair of numbers with the smallest difference.<br>

Sample input: arrayOne = [1, 5, 10, 20, 28, 3]<br>
             arrayTwo = [26, 134, 135, 15, 17]<br>

Sample output: [28, 26]<br>
